=head1 NAME

Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled - Run processes in parallel based on CPU usage

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.16

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled;

    # my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled->new( attrib => value, ... );
    my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled->new;

    # Used just like Parallel::ForkManager, so I'll paraphrase its documentation

    for my $data (@all_data) {
        # $pid is set to the child process' PID
        my $pid = $pm->start and next;

        # In the child process now
        # do some work ..

        # Exit the child
        $pm->finish; 
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module inherits from Parallel::ForkManager and adds the ability
to automatically manage the number of processes running based on how
busy the system is by watching the CPU idle time. Each time a child is
about to be start()ed a new value for B<max_procs> may be calculated
(if enough time has passed since the last calculation). If a new value
is calculated, the number of processes to run will be adjusted by
calling B<set_max_procs> with the new value.

Without specifying any attributes to the constructor, some defaults will
be set for you (see Attributes below).

=head2 Attributes

Attributes are just methods that may be passed to the constructor (C<new()>) and 
most may be changed during the life of the returned object. They take
as a parameter a new value to set for the attribute and return the current
value (or new value if one was passed).

=over

=item B<hard_min_procs>

The number of running processes will never be adjusted lower than this value.

default: 1

=item B<hard_max_procs>

The number of running processes will never be adjusted higher than this value.

default: The detected number of CPUs * 2

=item B<soft_min_procs>

=item B<soft_max_procs>

This is initially set to B<hard_min_procs> and B<hard_max_procs> respectively
and is adjusted over time. These are used when calculating adjustments as the 
minimum and maximum number of processes respectively. 

Over time B<soft_min_procs> and B<soft_max_procs> should approach the same value
for a consistent workload and a machine not otherwise busy.

Depending on the needs of the system, these values may also diverge if
necessary to try to reach B<idle_target>.

You may adjust these values if you wish by passing a value to the method
but you probably shouldn't. :)

=item B<initial_procs> (read-only)

The number of processes to start running before attempting any adjustments,
B<max_procs> will be set to this value upon initialization.

default: half way between B<soft_min_procs> and B<soft_max_procs>

=item B<update_frequency>

The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that must elapse between checks
of the system CPU's idle % and updates to the number of running processes.

Set this to 0 to cause a check before each call to C<start()>.

Before each call to C<start()> the time is compared with the last time a 
check/update was performed. If this much time has passed, a new check will be
made of how busy the CPU is and the number of processes may be adjusted.

default: 1

=item B<idle_target>

Percentage of CPU idle time to try to maintain by adjusting the number of running
processes between B<hard_min_procs> and B<hard_max_procs>

default: 0  # try to keep the CPU 100% busy (0% idle)

=item B<idle_threshold>

Only make adjustments if the current CPU idle % is this distance away from B<idle_target>.
In other words, only adjust if C<abs(B<cur_idle> - B<idle_target>) E<gt> B<idle_threshold>>.
This may be a fractional value (floating point).

You may notce that the default B<idle_target> of 0 and B<idle_threshold> of 1
would seem to indicate that the processes would never be adjusted as idle can
never be less than 0%. At the limits, the threshold is adjusted so that we
will still attempt adjustments, something like this:

    min_ok = max(0,   idle_target - idle_threshold)
    max_ok = min(100, idle_target - idle_threshold)

    adjust if idle >= max_ok
    adjust if idle <= min_ok

default: 1

=item B<run_on_update>

This is a callback function that is run immediately after (possibly) 
adjusting B<max_procs>. This allows you to override the default behavior 
of this module for your own nefarious purposes.

B<run_on_update> expects a coderef which will be called with two
parameters:

=over

=item * 

The object being adjusted. ($obj)

=item *

The old value for $obj-E<gt>max_procs. If you decide you have a
better idea of what max_procs should be, in your callback just
set it via $obj-E<gt>set_max_procs($new_value).

=back

The return value from the callback is ignored.

Example:

  $pm->run_on_update( sub{
      my ($obj, $old_max_procs) = @_;
      $obj->set_max_procs($old_max_procs+1);
  });

=item B<tempdir>

This is passed to the Parallel::ForkManager constructor to set
tempdir. Where Parallel::ForkManager is constructed thusly:

  my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager->new($procs, $tempdir);

The equivalent for this module would be:

  my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled->new(initial_procs => $procs, tempdir => $tempdir);

=back

=head2 Methods

All methods inherited from L<Parallel::ForkManager> plus the following:

=over

=item B<dump_stats>

Print the string returned by B<stats> to STDERR. This may be used as a
callback with B<run_on_update> to see diagnostics as processes are run:

  $pm->run_on_update(\&Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled::dump_stats)

=item B<last_update>

Returns the last C<time()> stats were updated via B<update_stats_pct>.

=item B<idle>

Returns the system's idle percentage as of B<last_update>.

Note that it's possible for B<idle> to be NaN if not enough time has elapsed
between the when the object was built and the most recent call to 
B<update_stats_pct>. Once enough time has elapsed for an idle % to be
calculated, B<idle> will never contain an NaN value.

=item B<ncpus>

The number of CPUs detected on the system, this is just
a wrapper to the cpus function from L<Unix::Statgrab>.

=item B<set_max_procs>

This method overrides B<set_max_procs> from L<Parallel::ForkManager> and
automatically constrains the new value to be within B<soft_min_procs> and
B<soft_max_procs> inclusive.

=item B<stats>

Returns a formatted string with information about the
current status. Takes a single parameter, the old
value for B<max_procs>. If no parameter is passed,
the vlaue B<max_procs> will be used.

=back

=head3 Method(s) you probably don't need to use

These are not meant for general consumption but are available anyway.
Probably best to avoid them :)

=over

=item B<update_stats_pct>

This method will attempt to update CPU stats (idle, etc). It is 
automatically called before each child process is C<start()>ed if
at least B<update_frequency> seconds has elapsed since the last call.

If not enough time has elapsed since the last call to B<update_stats_pct> it's
possible to get NaN for the new B<idle> stat. In this case no updates
will be made.

If B<idle> is updated, B<last_update> will also be updated with the time.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

These examples are also provided in the examples/ directory of 
this distribution.

=head2 Maximize CPU usage

see: examples/prun.pl

Run shell commands that are passed into the program and try to
keep the CPU busy, i.e. 0% idle

    use Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled;

    my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled->new(
        run_on_update => \&Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled::dump_stats
    );
    
    # just to be sure we can saturate the CPU
    $pm->hard_max_procs($pm->ncpus * 4);

    $pm->set_waitpid_blocking_sleep(0);

    while (<>) {
        chomp;
        $pm->start and next;

        # In the child now, run the shell process
        system $_;
        $pm->finish;
    }

=head2 Dummy Load

see: examples/dummy_load.pl

This example provides a way to test the capabilities of this module.
Try changing the idle_target and other settings to see the effect.

    use Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled;

    my $pm = Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled->new(
        run_on_update => \&Parallel::ForkManager::Scaled::dump_stats,
        idle_target => 50,
    );

    $pm->set_waitpid_blocking_sleep(0);

    for my $i (0..1000) {
        $pm->start and next;

        my $start = time;
        srand($$);
        my $lifespan = 5+int(rand(10));

        # Keep the CPU busy until it's time to exit
        while (time - $start < $lifespan) { 
            my $a = time; 
            my $b = $a^time/3;
        }

        $pm->finish;
    }

=head1 NOTES

Currently this module only works on systems where Unix::Statgrab is available,
which is probably any system where the libstatgrab library can compile.
